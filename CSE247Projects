Hi everyone, my name is Mustafa Ahmed and I am an aspiring software engineer.

I am currently taking CSE247, Data Structures and Algorithms. In this course, I will take my knowledge of computer science to the next level, 
using complex data structures to write algorithms, and analyzing the time and space complexities of those algorithms as well.
