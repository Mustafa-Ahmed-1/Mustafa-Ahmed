<h2>About me:</h2>

<p>Hi! My name is Mustafa Ahmed and I lived in Cairo, Egypt for 5 years. During my time in Cairo, I experienced a lot of different things the city had to offer, including monuments, museums, restaurants, and other places. Therefore, I have decided to make a website detailing my top 5 favorite places in Cairo. Enjoy! </p>

<h2>Location 1: The Pyramids</h2>

<br>
<br>

<p> No blog talking about Egypt would be complete without mentioning the pyramids. Being one of the 7 wonders of the world, the Pyramids are a fascinating sight. When I visited them for the first time, I got the chance to climb inside. Although it was really tight and humid, it was definitely a valuable experience. The next time I visited the pyramids, it was during my graduation. That's right! I graduated in front of the pyramids. </p>

<h2> Location 2: The Egyptian Museum</h2>

<p>For those of you interested in Egyptian history, I recommend the Egyptian Museum. This museum is the oldest archaeological museum in the Middle East. It houses the largest collection of Pharaonic antiquities, and spans a collection of artifacts from the Predynastic era to the Greco-Roman era. Among the museum's unrivaled collection are the complete burials of Yuya and Thuya, Psusennes I and the treasures of Tanis, and the Narmer Palette commemorating the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under one king, which is also among the museum's invaluable artifacts.</p>

<h2> Location 3: Cairo Festival City</h2>

<p>Cairo Festival City is one of the best malls in Cairo. It has multiple different stores, restaurants, and recreational centers including a skiing center and an arcade. Below are some of their operating hours:</p>

<table style="text-align: center">
	<tr>
		<td>Service</td>
		<td>Operating Hours</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>Fashion and Retail</td>
        <td>10:00 AM to 10:00 PM</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>Food Court, Restaurants, and Entertainment Stores</td>
        <td>10:00 AM to 12:00 AM</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>I've been to Cairo Festival City (also known as CFC) multiple times when I lived in Egypt. I've gone skiing there, went to the arcade, watched movies, and generally made a lot of memories at CFC. I would highly recommend going there with friends.</p>

<h2> Location 4: Al Andalus Garden</h2>

<br>
<br>

<p>For my nature lovers, look no further than Al Andalus Garden. It is described as "A preserved oasis with traditional Andalusian-style architecture and beautiful views of the Nile". One of the most unique aspects of the park are the preserved old structures designed in the traditional Andalusian architectural style, based on designs from Moorish Spain. The lush greenery is studded with colorful mosaic benches and steps surrounding a large fountain.</p>

<h2> Location 5: Al Dayaa Restaurant</h2>

<!-- insert image here -->
<img src="https://www.billyparisi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kofta-1.jpg" alt="Restaurant">
<br>
<br>

<p>Al Dayaa is a Lebanese restaurant that is about 5 minutes away from my home in Cairo. It has a many Lebanese food stapes as well as some Egyptian options including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hummus</li>
<li>Kofta (Beef)</li>
<li>Shish Taouk (Chicken)</li>
<li>Pidgeon</li>
</ul>

<p>I recommend ordering hummus, Kofta, and Shish Taouk if you go. My personal favorite dish is the kofta, but some people prefer shisa taouk as their main dish. Additionally, pidgeon is a delicacy in Cairo, but it is definitely not for everyone.</p>
